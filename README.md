Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains the instructions and code on how to run the analysis.

Dataset provided:
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files added to the repo:
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R carries data preparation to get a tidy data set and also the five steps required in the course projectâ€™s specification:
1:Merges the training and the test sets.
2:Extracts the measurements of the mean and standard deviation.
3:Uses descriptive activity names.
4:Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
F5:From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
tidy_data.txt is the output of the final data.
