run_analysis.R script prepares the data and then accomplish the course projectâ€™s 5 steps.

##Acquiring the data set
Download and extract the data under folder UCI HAR Dataset

##Conversion to Data Frame
It converts the data set into a data frame file by file
data.test <-  data.frame(data.test.subject, data.test.activity, data.test.x)
names(data.test) <- c(c('subject', 'activity'), features)

##Merging test and train sets 
It merges into data.all the test and train sets. 
data.all <- rbind(data.train, data.test)

##Standard deviation and mean for each measurement
It calculates the standard deviation and mean for the test and train measurements
mean_std.select <- grep('mean|std', features)
data.sub <- data.all[,c(1,2,mean_std.select + 2)]

##Using Descriptipe activity names
By reading the labels from the activity_labels.txt file it Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

##Labeling data set appropriately 
The code replaces the names in data set with names from activity labels
names(data.sub) <- name.new

##Creation of a second tidy data set and output
write.table(x = data.tidy, file = "tidy_data.txt", row.names = FALSE)
